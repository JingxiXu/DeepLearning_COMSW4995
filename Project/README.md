The following files present the code for the major models mentioned in the final report. We have not included all the experiments we have tried in the repository to keep the repository clean and the code readable. 

- `source/wide_and_deep.ipynb` The wide&deep model.
- `source/Content-based DNN.ipynb` 
    - The Content-based DNN as mentioned in the final report
    - The DNN with uid and sid that achieves the best result is also included in this ipynb
- `source/simple_logistic_regression.ipynb` A simple model using logistic regression
- `source/simple_lgbm.ipynb` A simple model using gradient boosting with package `lgbm`
- `proposal.pdf` The research proposal for this project.
- `milestone.pdf` The milestone report for this project.
- `example_feature.csv` The whole feature generated after feature engineering, only contains first 5 columns in all training set.
